1. Flash the PCB if it isn't already. You can test this by putting a switch into any socket and pressing it. If it sends a keystroke, you're probably good. If it isn't flashed:
   1. Follow the QMK guide and flash it using this repo: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ut472
1. Insert the switches into the plate. Make sure that it is oriented correctly. Almost all of the switches have the metal pins toward the top of the PCB. The only one that doesn't is the top right one
1. Insert the 2u stabilizer on the bottom row in the middle. This isn't strictly necessary but most people prefer it.
1. With the switch plate upside down, slowly press the PCB into place. If you get resistance, check if there is a bent pin.
1. Screw the top and bottom plate together using the standoffs and screws.
